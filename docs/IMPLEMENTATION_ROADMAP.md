## Current State Summary

| Service | Status | What Works |
|---------|--------|------------|
| user-service | 100% Phase 1 | Auth, User CRUD, Search, Roles, Flyway, Friendship API |
| expense-service | 0% | Stub only |

| DevOps | 100% Phase 0 | CI Pipeline, Test Coverage, Dockerfile |

**What's Missing for MVP:**
1. Entire expense-service

---

## Phase 0: DevOps Foundation ✅
> **Goal:** Automated quality gates before adding more features  
> **Duration:** ~2 days

### Story S01: GitHub Actions CI Pipeline ✅
> Branch: `feature/S01-github-actions-ci`

**Why:** Every commit should be validated automatically. Catch issues early.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Push to `main` or PR triggers build
- [x] Maven build + test runs
- [x] Build fails if tests fail
- [x] Badge shows build status in README

**Tasks:**
| ID | Task | Est | Notes |
|----|------|-----|-------|
| T01.1 | Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with Maven build | 2h | ✅ Trigger on push/PR to main |
| T01.2 | Add build status badge to README | 15m | ✅ |

**Test Strategy:** CI itself is the test — verify a failing test breaks the build.

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (new)
- `README.md` (add badge)

---

### Story S02: Test Coverage Reporting ✅
> Branch: `feature/S02-test-coverage`

**Why:** Know what's tested, prevent coverage regression.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Tasks:**
| ID | Task | Est | Notes |
|----|------|-----|-------|
| T02.1 | Add JaCoCo plugin to user-service pom.xml | 1h | ✅ Configure report generation |
| T02.2 | Set coverage threshold (60% lines) | 30m | ✅ Build fails if below |
| T02.3 | Update CI to publish coverage report | 1h | ✅ Upload as artifact |

**Test Strategy:** Intentionally drop coverage below threshold, verify build fails.

**Files to Modify:**
- `user-service/pom.xml`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---
